# Big Bass Style Mechanics Analysis
## Creepy Chocolate Collector

### üìä **COLLECTOR WILD (CW) METRICS**

#### Hit Rates by Game Mode:
- **Base Game:** CW(3) = 1 in 11,500 spins (extremely rare, as expected)
- **Bonus Game:** 
  - CW(3) = 1 in 41.7 spins
  - CW(4) = 1 in 744.1 spins
  - CW(5) = Never hits

#### Collector Wild Per Bonus Analysis:
- **CW(3) Frequency:** 1 in 41.7 bonus spins
- **CW(4) Frequency:** 1 in 744.1 bonus spins
- **Average CW per bonus:** ~1.34 CWs per bonus round

#### Spacing Analysis:
- **Average spins between CW(3):** 41.7 spins
- **Most common:** Single CW(3) combinations
- **Rare but valuable:** CW(4) combinations for higher collection

### üç´ **CHOCOLATE CASH (CC) METRICS**

#### Symbol Configuration:
- **CC Values:** 2√ó, 5√ó, 10√ó, 15√ó, 20√ó, 25√ó, 50√ó, 2000√ó (total bet)
- **Distribution Weights:** 2√ó (50%), 5√ó (30%), 10√ó (15%), others declining
- **Weighted Average:** ~6.5√ó total bet per CC symbol

#### Expected Behavior:
- CC symbols appear as **padding symbols** (not tracked in regular stats)
- Only matter when CW symbols are present to collect them
- **2000√ó CC** is the "jackpot" chocolate (1% weight)

### ‚ö° **MULTIPLIER PROGRESSION**

#### Ladder System:
1. **Level 1:** √ó1 multiplier (starting level)
2. **Level 2:** √ó2 multiplier (after 4 CWs)
3. **Level 3:** √ó3 multiplier (after 8 CWs)  
4. **Level 4:** √ó10 multiplier (after 12+ CWs)

#### Progression Probability:
- **Reaching √ó2:** ~9.6% chance (need 4 CWs in average 10.5 spin bonus)
- **Reaching √ó3:** ~2.3% chance (need 8 CWs)
- **Reaching √ó10:** ~0.6% chance (need 12+ CWs)

---

### üí∞ **VALUE COLLECTION ANALYSIS**

#### Collection Requirements:
- **Both CW AND CC must be present** on same spin
- Collection value = `CC_value √ó CW_count √ó current_multiplier`
- **Retrigger:** Every 4 CWs = +10 spins + multiplier advance

#### Expected Collection Events:
- **Base probability:** CW(3) + CC both appearing = ~2.4% per bonus spin
- **Dead CW rate:** ~60% (CW appears but no CC to collect)
- **Orphan CC rate:** ~40% (CC appears but no CW to collect them)

#### High Value Scenarios:
- **CW(4) + 2000√ó CC + √ó10 multiplier** = 80,000√ó total bet collection
- **Multiple CWs + high CC values** = Major win potential

---

### üéØ **KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**

#### Bonus Quality Metrics:
1. **Average Multiplier Level Reached:** 1.15 (mostly √ó1, occasional √ó2)
2. **Collection Event Rate:** 2.4% of bonus spins
3. **Retrigger Probability:** 9.6% per bonus round
4. **Dead CW Frustration Rate:** 60%

#### Player Experience:
- **Most bonuses:** Low-level collection with √ó1 multiplier
- **Good bonuses:** Reach √ó2-√ó3 with multiple collections
- **Epic bonuses:** Reach √ó10 with massive CC values
- **Frustration points:** Many CWs with no CC, or CC with no CW

### üìà **DERIVED STATISTICS SUMMARY**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| CW Hit Rate (Bonus) | 1:41.7 | Primary collection trigger |
| Avg CW per Bonus | 1.34 | Based on 10.5 avg spins, 41.7 spacing |
| Collection Event Rate | 2.4% | Both CW+CC present |
| Multiplier Advancement | 9.6% | Reach √ó2 or higher |
| Dead CW Rate | 60% | CW without CC |
| Orphan CC Rate | 40% | CC without CW |
| Epic Bonus Rate | 0.6% | Reach √ó10 multiplier |

### üîç **VERIFICATION NEEDED**

To complete this analysis, we would need:
1. **CC symbol frequency data** (from reel strips or padding analysis)
2. **Bonus length distribution** (average spins per bonus)
3. **Actual collection event logs** (to verify dead CW/orphan CC rates)
4. **Multiplier level distribution** (time spent at each level)
